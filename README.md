go to https://cinefave.vercel.app/ to see the deployed version of the app, and definitely try it out on a mobile device

go to loom to see the walkthrough video

some thing did not mention in the video:

you can view the Debugger page if you click on the avatar of the user and you will see it in the menu list

you can run test for the client in the terminal by typing npm run test and you will see the result of the test
